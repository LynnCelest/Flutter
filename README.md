# Flutter Course

Learning how to use flutter. It's incredible how many parts of front end code it simplifies.
I'm very fond of the workflow. Now that this is done I'll make a journaling app. It will have 
a scaffolding and note entry system that auto generates names, counters, and more with clicking 
instead of typing! Stay tuned for it. ^^ I'll use it to take notes while playing Elden Ring.
